# node-red-contrib-mqtt-dynamictopic
This is a node module for node-red that is identical to the default MQTT node. The difference with the MQTT node is that this dynamic node supports topics/channels passed through msg.topic.

# Installing
Simply install using the palette in node-red.

### Creds
I have used `node-red-contrib-mqtt-env` as a raw base for this node. Thank you.

# Version
This is a fork of `node-red-contrib-mqtt-dynamictopic`
=> correct multi subscriptions usage and unsubscriptions.
